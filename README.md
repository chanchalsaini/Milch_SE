## Overview
Brief Idea about the Milch app
The purpose of the Milch app is for maintaining the ledger of all the products that are being sold by the dairy every day. The app could be used by the owner to maintain the ledger. Moreover, the owner can add or remove the customer. The owner will maintain ledger daily. At the month-end, every customer will get a notification about their credit to the dairy. This is a brief overview, the app has other elaborate features as well as a reminder, the penalty for delay, payment gateway, payment history, complaint register, home delivery, etc.
